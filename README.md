# javascript-calculator
This was one of my most dificult projects so far, I tried to do all by myself but got stuck in most part of it, so I decided to follow a guide on how to code a proper js calculator, but as I followed through the guide my main goal was to really understand what I was doing in each part of the project.
Use a Class with an eventListener to call a function that I want was a new and nice concept that I had learn.

The design was based on a figma file.
